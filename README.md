These are custom .cfg files for my QIDI-XMAX3. 

WARNING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Before you use my files you will need to install full klipper through the FREEDI wiki. I cant say enough about how much the FREEDI conversion of my printer has changed my prints! You should definetly try it! Donate! This person deserves compensation for their work!  

LOOK!..... I'm lazy! This project started because I can't be bothered to turn on and off my printer. The switch is on the back!...WHY???? My printer is bolted to a work bench for stability. This makes it almost impossible for someone to reach it!

Im not an expert! Im barely able to clothe myself so use these files at your own risk! 

You should probably after the FREEDI install, FORK mainline klipper! 

You will need to add EXTRAS/shell_commands through KIAUH. 

And add to the moonraker.conf/[file_manager] files.
