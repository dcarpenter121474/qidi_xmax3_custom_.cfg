These are custom .cfg files for my QIDI-XMAX3. 

WARNING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Before you use my files you will need to install full klipper through the FREEDI wiki.

LOOK!..... I'm lazy! This project started because I can't be bothered to turn on and off my printer. The switch is on the back!...WHY???? My printer is bolted to a work bench for stability. This makes it almost impossible for someone reach it!

Im not an expert! Im barely able to clothe myself so use these files at your own risk! 

You should probably after the FREEDI install, FORK mainline klipper! 

You will need to add EXTRAS/shell_commands through KIAUH. 

And add to the moonraker.conf/[file_manager] files.
